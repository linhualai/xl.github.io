Features:

* pygments highlighting of codeblocks with caching
* table of contents generation with pretty section numbers
* table of contents section renaming: `# Some Header {toc="show this way in toc"}`
* blockquotes with pretty borders
* atom feed generation
* abbreviation support. abbreviations are defined as `*[GHC]: Glasgow Haskell Compiler`

Todo:

* possible optimization for pygments: combine all similar language code blocks into one "file"
